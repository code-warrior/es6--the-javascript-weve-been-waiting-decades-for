# ES6: The JavaScript We’ve Been Waiting Decades For
A workshop given at NYU’s ITP Camp 2018 about ES6

## Browser
We’ll be using Chrome for the in-class examples. Make sure to have the latest version installed. As of this writing, `Version 67.0.3396.87` is the newest version.

## Gulp
If you’d like to use Gulp to reload changes, do the following:

1. Make sure to have Java installed.
2. Load the Node modules: `npm i`
3. Run `gulp serve`
